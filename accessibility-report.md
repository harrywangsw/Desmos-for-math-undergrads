- Equitable Use: 
The primary target of our application is the math undergrads, it acts as a supporting tool for ODE(ordinary differential equation). By using our program they can get the solutions as well as the critical points, it has the function to plot the equations in a graph and display the phase portrait. In the future, we aim to make our program appealing to all users. For those that are not in the math program, we will create a user guideline to introduce them to the basic knowledge of ODE so that they can benefit from our program as well. Additionally we will also add a language select option to the menu so the users with language barrier can understand our program as well.

Flexibility in Use: 
Our program has various functionality for the user to choose, the user can choose to get the solutions and critical points in symbolic form or If they want to look at the solution visually, they can choose the options in the drop down menu to display the visualization of the solution being plotted in a 2D graph, the graph of the phase portrait as well as the previous graph.

Simple and Intuitive:
Our program has just one menu and the user can access all the functionality through this menu which is straightforward and easy to use and the graph can also be zoomed in to let the users see the details.

Perceptible Information:
Right now our program only has the pictorial mode. In the future, we aim to add the verbal mode to read out the solutions.

Tolerance of Error:
When designing our program we tried to minimize the possibility of the occurrence of an error by testing each of our methods using different test cases, we also use throw exceptions in case an error occurs. For example, in the plot function we built, the method will if an inputting error occurs, another window will pop out displaying invalid input.

Low Physical Effort:
This principle does not apply to our program since our program is a software that requires no physical effort.

Size and Space for Approach and Use:
This principle does not apply to our program since our program is a software that requires no space or mobility.


If we were to enhance and sell our program, the primary target of our customer would be students, educators, and professionals in math fields. This includes high school and college students who need a supporting tool for visualizing mathematical concepts, such as graphing equations or analyzing data trends. Educators such as teachers and professors could also be our customers. They can use the program as a teaching aid to enhance their lecture quality and improve classroom engagement by demonstrating the visualisation of specific math concepts. Additionally, data analysts could also find the program valuable for modelling and solving complex systems. 



Certain demographics may be less likely to use the program due to limited access to technology, such as people in some places that have poor internet connection, or people that have an old and slow computer. These individuals might have trouble loading the menu and the graph. Additionally, users with visual impairments might face challenges if the program lacks features like text readers, and people with language barriers might face challenges if the program only supports one language. After addressing these problems, we will try to upgrade more features to our program to follow the principle of universal design as closely as possible.
