## Principles of Universal Design

### Equitable Use
- **Target Audience**: The application is primarily designed for math undergraduates as a support tool for Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs).
- **Core Features**: Users can solve systems of ODEs, identify critical points, and visualize solutions through graphs and phase portraits.
- **Future Plans**:
    - Develop user-friendly guidelines to introduce ODE concepts for non-specialists.
    - Implement a language selection feature to support diverse linguistic backgrounds.

### Flexibility in Use
- **Adaptable Outputs**: Users can choose between symbolic solutions and graphical visualizations.
- **Visualization Options**: Solutions can be displayed as 2D graphs or phase portraits, allowing users to interact with the data in various ways.
- **User Preferences**: The dropdown menu provides easy access to multiple functionalities tailored to different skill levels and learning styles.

### Simple and Intuitive
- **Streamlined Interface**: A single, straightforward menu provides access to all features.
- **User-Friendly Navigation**: Designed for first-time users with a minimal learning curve.
- **Graph Interaction**: Zoom functionality enables users to examine intricate details, enhancing the clarity of visual data.

### Perceptible Information
- **Current Features**: Information is presented visually through graphs and symbolic outputs.
- **Planned Enhancements**:
    - Introduce audio feedback for reading solutions and critical points aloud.
    - Improve accessibility for users with visual impairments or reading difficulties.

### Tolerance for Error
- **Error Prevention**: Extensive testing ensures reliability and reduces errors.
- **Error Messages**: Clear prompts, such as "Invalid Input," guide users to correct mistakes.
- **Robust Design**: Handles unexpected inputs gracefully to maintain program stability.

### Low Physical Effort
- **Minimal Interaction**: The program requires only basic keyboard and mouse inputs.
- **Efficient Navigation**: Features are accessible with minimal clicks, reducing physical strain.

### Size and Space for Approach and Use
- **Standard Sizing**: Buttons and text fields follow standard design conventions for ease of use.
- **Consistent Layout**: Interface elements are spaced consistently for better navigation.
- **Zoom Functionality**: Enhances visibility for users who need larger displays.

## Target Audience
Our program is designed for a wide range of users in mathematics and related fields:

Students in high school and college can use the application as a learning aid to solve and visualize ODE solutions. It helps them comprehend complex concepts through both symbolic outputs and graphical visualizations. Educators, such as teachers and professors, can integrate the program into their teaching methods, enhancing lecture quality with clear demonstrations of mathematical principles. Additionally, professionals like engineers and data analysts may find the tool useful for modeling and analyzing dynamic systems, making it suitable for both academic and professional environments.

## Demographic Considerations
Certain demographic groups might encounter challenges in accessing or using the program effectively. Visually impaired users may struggle with the lack of screen reader compatibility and audio output features. To address this, planned updates include the integration of text-to-speech functionality and screen reader support. Users in low-resource areas, such as those with limited internet connectivity or older hardware, might face performance issues. Solutions like offline capabilities and optimization for low-end systems will help mitigate these challenges. For non-native speakers, language barriers could pose difficulties. Implementing multi-language support is a priority to enhance accessibility for a global audience. Finally, individuals with limited technical experience might find the program daunting at first. A beginner-friendly "Getting Started" guide and detailed tutorials are planned to simplify onboarding and usage. These updates aim to ensure the program aligns with universal design principles, making it accessible to a diverse range of users.
